"I joined a new league this year and they have different scoring rules than I'm used to. It's a slight PPR league- .2 PPR. Standard besides 1 points for 15 yards receiving, .2 points per completion, 6 points per TD thrown, and some bonuses for rec/rush/pass yardage. My question is, is it wildly clear that QB has the highest potential for points? I put in the rules at a ranking site and noticed that top QBs had 300 points more than the top RB/WR. Would it be dumb not to grab a QB in the first round?"
"In your scenario, a person could just not run the mandatory background check on the buyer and still sell the gun to the felon. There's no way to enforce it. An honest seller is going to not sell the gun to them when they see they're a felon on the background check. A dishonest seller isn't going to run the check in the first place. No one is going to be honest enough to run the check, see they're a felon, and then all of a sudden immediately turn dishonest and say ""nah, you know what, here's your gun anyway."" They wouldn't run the fucking check in the first place, genius. Your bullshit proposal is **NOT ENFORCEABLE**. This is why people without 

&gt;Here's an idea, why not make a background check system where it would be illegal to sell guns to felons? That doesn't convince you? IDGAF.

We already fucking have that. What aren't you understanding about this?! It's just currently not available to private sellers. I'd like to make it available, but there's no point in making it mandatory.

&gt;You're just supporting it to make a gesture towards background check reform in bad faith.

As a gun owner who has harmed no one and has constitutionally protected rights, I actually don't own the anti-gun side a damn thing. It's people like you that convince me to not give an inch at all. I'm wiling to extend NICS to private sellers as voluntary. Take it or leave it, because it isn't going to be made mandatory. Not gonna happen. Period."

"I dunno, back before the August update in an A+ lobby for Tower Control in Saltspray Rig, I remember the enemy team barraging us with bombs in a suspiciously coordinated fashion.  And my teammates were also tossing bombs left and right.  Non-stop splat/suction/burst bombs.  Bombs, bombs fucking everywhere.  It was terrifying having to dodge one after the other.  It never ended, and some of them even had bomb rush to toss even more goddamn bombs.

I think I still have PTSD of that horrifying event.  That match really felt like a Michael Bay movie."

"I think you might be missing my point. A gun is a tool which allows you to kill very efficiently. Not having those around means there's less chance for people to make dumb decisions which end up in deaths. I'm not concerned with spree killers or other people who plan to kill, I'm concerned with people who wouldn't otherwise put other's lives at risk when they get angry, but there's a gun at hand. The latter is vastly more common than the former."

"Im Dutch and have watched all Netherlands games for the last few years, Nigel de Jong has been solid during the WC and before and I see no reason at all not to include him since we don't have any non attacking midfielders in our team other then Anita (which I don't really rate) and Blind (who we'll probably need as LB). Tete hasn't even been that good in the eredivisie IMO, so why put him ahead of a expierenced player in the Dutch squad like Janmaat is beyond me.  We don't have a real LB in the squad, only Blind and Kongolo (who didn't play well in a weak eredivisie last season) so that's why I would include Pieters.
   I'm not making assumptions here. I agree that our defense hasn't been that good, that's why I don't get why we don't use Nigel de Jong, that's why I wouldn't use young unexpierenced players like Riedewald and Tete. These matches are super important, we won't qualify if we don't win them, so if you want to experiment with other players I would always use more expierenced players and not players who played with each other before instead of new ones like Tete, Riedewald and Anita.

I prefer summons since they actually do really decent damage and clear maps very well if you have an acceptable range. Therefore, Murgoth is probably the best summoned soul or magnificent Magnus (which is also a summon). Prefixes usually determine what type of stat they will have. So for example A **clever** ""soul"" will provide the int stat or a **potent** ""soul"" will provide attack damage.

In terms of which of those is the most fun to level, for the average person its probably going to be grappler.

"Thanks to the despicable Judge Stephen Williams for explaining why our system of law is dog shit and our system of checks and balances is horribly broken in this document.

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.

That is a pretty rude answer. He didn't say that he wants doyalst answers only that immediately banning people doesn't really help anyone. Have you considered instead of these sweeping ultimatums you ask the members of the community their feelings? I much prefer watsonian discussions but there are times dolayst information has a place as well. If we had a spoiler tag we could use to put that under it would be the best of both worlds. The information could be presented in the relevant location but those who want a purely watsonian argument don't have to be interrupted with it. Also there is no logical reason to ban meta discussion involving multiple settings. Again that leads to great discussions. Being a mod you can either work with the community or for yourself. Maybe you should consider what you want to do. 
"It's true that vaccines aren't 100%.  No medication or medical procedure is 100% safe.  There is a risk that some people's bodies will ""overreact"", similar to an allergic reaction.  It's extremely rare, but it is a risk.  There is also a slight risk if the vaccine was stored improperly and bacteria infected the vile (this happens more frequently today because anti-vaxx advocates pushed for eliminating preservatives from vaccines because of misinformation about the preservatives on the internet, particularly thimerosal).

&gt; Lastly, doctors are not scientific leaders. They take the position of being told what to do and are, from day one, under the control of the drug manufactures.

It's not just doctors that agree vaccines are safe, it's the entire scientific community, because the scientific evidence is overwhelming and there has never been a scientifically verified reproducible study that has shown there is a significant danger to any vaccine in use today.  Period.

Millions of people take vaccines, and people who take vaccines are no more likely to develop any type of condition than those who don't."

"I am testing the mods atm, will post my impressions here.

1. The armor plates mod seems balanced to me, not overpowered.

2. Azimuth's oxygen generators are 1x1x1, this is almost OP. I'd rather had them 1x1x2. Haven't tested the tank volume and the oxy generator performance yet.

3. I tested this wake bomb and fell in love with it. It's requires completely different approah to bombing, as well as skill and luck. Not OP but fun as hell. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=354194728

4. Azimuth batteries are, in my opinion, OP, as well as their ""fusion"" reactors. Totally destroys the balance, irregardless of the resourse cost.

5. The ""armored"" thrusters look much better, provide the same amount of thrust, and the additional ""armor"" is almost non-existent. Can take a couple more gatling bullets, so not OP, but look much better and should make it into vanilla game. **Large ship armored thrusters require to be adjusted to the latest vanilla game rebalance!**

6. RCS thrusters are very good, should be in vanilla game too. Excellent for precise docking maneuvers, useless for anything else.

7. Accumulators and capacitors are great and seem balanced to me! Accumulators work like batteries that can store more energy, but their output is weaker. Could be great for storing solar energy in bases and large ships. Capacitors are the opposite: very low storage, but can provide big current, thus compensating for intermittent overloads. I checked the storage and output values vs battery volume. The 1x1x1 mini battery is fine, but the slim battery is a little underpowered and needs to be adjusted.

8. Afterburner is a very interesting concept, although, the implementation could be better. I'd like to have those in the game, and I even considered making a similar mod myself, but there is already an existing one.

9. The solar batteries mod I suggested includes centered panels as well. I checked the power output vs surface vs the vanilla panels. Big ships panels provide exactly the same power/surface area, and the small ship panels are just slightly less efficient. I strongly suggest this mod, it provides great flexibility with the three additional panel sizes and the centered panels as well. Another great mod that should be in vanilla game.

"If your energy is effected that severely, your daily calories are probably below your [Basal Metabolic Rate](http://www.myfitnesspal.com/tools/bmr-calculator). 


1. My BMR is 2064 cal/day, and I want to loose about 1.5 lb/week. 
2. I calculated my TDEE as 2477 (1.2 x BMR) since my job is sedentary. 
3. Now I want to lose 1.5 lb/week (1.5 lb/wk * 3500 lb/cal = 5250 cal/wk), but if I cut my diet by 750 (5250/7) cals/day to 1727 cal/day, I'd be below my BMR and very lethargic (like you describe). 
4. Instead I do about 2500 cal/wk of cardio and cut my diet to 2080 cal/day, just above my BMR.
5. My net calories per week is something like: (Food - TDEE) * 7 - Cardio = Deficit (2080-2477)*7-2500 = -5279 (close enough to my goal of 5250)

Hope this all makes sense! Let me know if you'd like another example with your numbers?"
"&gt; I'm a pro-lifer and I don't consider myself a social conservative.

Well that's fine and dandy that you don't consider yourself one; you *do* hold a social conservative view on at least one issue. Patrick Brown holds many, including: his stance on sex ed, his stance on gay marriage (at least in the past) and his stance on abortion; ergo he is a social conservative."
"It's over half a century old. Wonka was most definitely *not* the villain. The story was structured more like an old fairy tale where naughty children who don't listen get punished and the sweet, innocent charlie gets rewarded with his wildest dream.

"The ONDP targeted their messaging at blue-collar non-Toronto Ontario. The OLP successfully painted that as a move to the right, and continually claimed that they had produced the most progressive budget in history.

That's why the ONDP kept their vote and seat totals basically even, while seeing it shift away from Toronto. That's why people like Jonah Schein lost their seats. (Tellingly, it was the MPPs with unimpeachable leftist bona fides who survived, like Cheri DiNovo.)

The subsequent programme of the Liberals in government, however, has been radically neoliberal, stepping up attacks on unions and kicking the pace of privatisations into high gear. Anyone gullible enough to believe the hype about the OLP's supposed outlefting the ONDP has has learned the error oh their ways, and I don't think they're gonna fall for it this time when Trudeau tries it."
"&gt;Sure, the lump of cells might have started to grow into proto organs

Fully intact brains, hearts and livers.  My point is ... ""It's just a clump of cells"" is misleading in this case.

"I see so many cars and pickups towing trailers without tow mirrors, and as a truck driver, it's infuriating to see them get away with it.

The ""fanart"" usually being panels from the chapter you're about to read, so they often spoiled the chapter before you even get a chance to read it.

easy there... of the players that regularly took draws for the Stars last year he was the worst. Admittedly, the Stars were a good faceoff team, so that doesn't mean he was bad. And he improved a lot in the second half of the season, but he's got a ways to go before he earns ""excellent""."

To some that can mean trying out tweaks to their top decks. To some that can mean a place to do your quests with whatever top decks they like. To some that can mean a place to learn or perfect the playstyle of some top deck. To some it can mean a place to play as normal when they have a questionable internet connection."

"Because a Google search for how to do Aetherial Reduction lead me here only to tell me ""Hey! you should do that thing you're trying to figure out how to do! gl buddy!"" ...Not OP's fault, but in case anyone else ran into this frustration...

Here's how you do it:

1. Find an ephemeral node. I farm furrymints in Twinpools W. Coerthas from 12a - 4a for example, but they're on a timer all over the new areas. [There's probably a guide somewhere.](http://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Ephemeral_Nodes)

2. Switch on the Collector's Glove action before digging/hacking. It's in your actions list.. the hand by the square/pyramid thingy. It's a permanent thing that stays on.

3. Here's where I was getting confused. Click your furrymint or whatever and it will go to a screen with a 30/30 and it won't let you do jack (which was the point I started doing Google searches and found this thing about how awesome the thing I can't do is)

4. Don't do what I did instead do this.

5. Hit the skill Discerning Eye. Why? Still don't know. Just do it.

6. Now you can hit Utmost Caution skill and maybe some other stuff... again I still don't know what's going on, but it works :p

7. After hitting these cool skills you've had for 2 months without a clue as to what they did you can use ""Methodical Appraiser"" --which is the gather this stuff skill. You'll get something collectible woohoo.

8. Repeat that stuff till the node is empty. 

9. Go to your items, and now those collectibles will give you the option to Aetherial Reduce them.

I know nothing about how to get the best stuff, what the actions do, but it's a start, and it's better than yelling at Google for taking you here for an hour. gl."

It doesn't have that mileage, I absolutely guarantee."
"That's what I don't get too. It's as if OP and the retard in the thread didn't know that only Canada and Mexico have a leaf or leaves on their flags.

All the others either have either entire trees, or branches (olive branch being apparently the most popular). And by all the others I am talking about 6 other flags.

tl;dr; OP is a faggot, and the Australian in that thread was a faggot with OP"

Of course they have discussed it. His entire job is to manage this roster of players. Their star acquisition is slumping hard and you don't think they would even talk about possible ways to address that?

There just seems to be something much more interesting about the Bucs than the Panthers. Maybe it's the pirate thing or the fact that the Panthers win a decent amount of games meanwhile when the Bucs win one its like the greatest week of your life"
